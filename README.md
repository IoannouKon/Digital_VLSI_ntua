Welcome to the Digital VLSI repository for the NTUA University's course during the academic year 2022-2023. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for digital VLSI design using VHDL in the Vivado tool, along with High-Level Synthesis (HLS).

## Overview

This repository encompasses a range of topics covered in the Digital VLSI course at ECE NTUA, including:

1. **Course Content**: Introduction to VHDL language, pipeline utilization for adders and multipliers, FIR filter, Debayer filter, IP component creation, and FPGA implementation using Zybo 2.0.

2. **Laboratory Implementations**: The repository contains six laboratory implementations with increasing complexity. These cover fundamental concepts such as adders, flip-flops, 4-bit adders, and multipliers, progressing to advanced topics like FIR and DeBayer filters, culminating in FPGA (Zybo) implementation.

3. **Theoretical Analyses and Methodologies**: General examples and theoretical analyses are provided for VHDL, RAM, FSM, Wallace multipliers, counters, critical path determination, and delays.

4. **HLS FIR Filter Project**: A simple project demonstrates the implementation of an FIR filter in HLS. Various techniques to enhance resource utilization and reduce latency are explored. Additionally, comparisons with VHDL implementation of FIR filters are presented. The project also includes an HLS classifier, detailed explanations, and testing of directives for hardware optimization.

This repository aims to serve as a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts interested in digital VLSI design and FPGA implementation.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation, and contributions are always welcome!
