Introduction to digital VLSI using vhdl in vivado tool as well as HLS.
Answers to the Digital VLSI course of NTUA University for the academic year 2022-2023.
Introduction to the Vhdl language, use of pipelines for adders and multipliers, FIR filter, Debayer filter, IP component creation and implementation in fpga. For the exercises I used Zybo 2.0

The present GitHub repository is the implementation for various applications and designs carried out in the course Digital VLSI at ECE NTUA during the academic year 2022-2023.

The repository contains
1) Six laboratory implementations with escalating difficulty, which include simple introductory implementations of basic components such as adders, flip-flops, 4-bit adders, and multipliers, up to the implementation of FIR and DeBayer filters, as well as their implementation on an FPGA (Zybo).
2) General examples "Theoretical analyses and basic methodologies for implementation in VHDL, RAM, FSM, Wallace multipliers, counters, as well as theoretical determination of critical paths and delays.
3)  A simple project that implements an FIR filter in HLS explores various methods to improve resource consumption and latency. It also compares the results with the implementation of FIR in VHDL. Additionally, it includes an HLS classifier, along with explanations and testing of various directives and improvements in hardware implementation.
