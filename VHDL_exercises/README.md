###  [Exercise 1](./VLSI-1(introduction))

#### A2) Decoder 3 to 8 with Two Different Architectures: Dataflow and Behavioral

#### B2) Shift Register with Selectable Left/Right Shifting

![Shift Register Diagram](https://github.com/IoannouKon/Digital_VLSI_ntua/assets/132226067/d418ddf7-3f22-473f-ab9b-d0fe5dae0391)

This shift register includes an additional input (std_logic) to choose between left and right shifting. In left shifting, the output is the MSB of the register, while the serial input comes from the LSB.

#### B3) Counter

Based on the provided counter, we describe a 3-bit up counter with a parallel input modulo (counting limit) of 3 bits.

We also describe an up/down counter based on the provided counter implementation.

### [Exercise 2](./VLSI-2(ADDERS))
The purpose of the laboratory exercise is to familiarize students with the design methodology using structural description. Specifically, students will design complex computational circuits using pre-implemented hardware modules.

1) Implement a Half Adder (HA) using a Dataflow description.

2) Implement a Full Adder (FA) using a Structural description, based on the structural unit of Question 1.

4) Implement a BCD Full Adder (BCD FA) using a Structural description. Utilize the structural unit implemented in Question 3, any structural unit from the previous questions, and any additional logic you consider necessary.
