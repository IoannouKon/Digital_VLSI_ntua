#### B2) Shift Register with Selectable Left/Right Shifting

This shift register includes an additional input (std_logic) to choose between left and right shifting. In left shifting, the output is the MSB of the register, while the serial input comes from the LSB.

#### B3) Counter

Based on the provided counter, we describe a 3-bit up counter with a parallel input modulo (counting limit) of 3 bits.

We also describe an up/down counter based on the provided counter implementation.

Feel free to adjust the formatting and add any additional information you deem necessary for your Git README.
